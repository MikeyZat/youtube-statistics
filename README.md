# youtube-statistics
Jupyter notebook which shows your YouTube statistics based on your liked videos.

This is pure fun & educational project for me - I just wanted to practise python a little bit, get used to YouTube API and recall my matplotlib skills.

Check this [Jupyter Notebook](./src/main.ipynb) to see it live.
